# Digital Steganography

Digital Steganography is a Java application that enables the embedding and extraction of secret messages within digital images. Steganography is the practice of concealing information within other non-secret data to maintain the confidentiality of the message. This project utilizes the technique of LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography to embed text messages within image files.
